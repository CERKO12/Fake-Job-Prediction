Project: Fake Job Prediction

Team Member: Congkai Sun, Jie Kuai, Maojie Xia

The purpose of this project is to evaluate different models that can distinguish between real jobs and fake jobs.

Original dataset is in fake_job_postings.csv. In fake_job_EDA.ipynb, we use several statistical and analytical methods to reduce the dimension of the features of the job information in the database and select the features which have strong relationship for job prediction. The updated dataset is written into df_cleaned.csv. Finally in fake_job_model.ipynb, we choose the most suitable model for distinguishing fake jobs and real jobs.
